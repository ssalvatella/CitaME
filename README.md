This application is an example of how it is possible to implement a modern view in a language like COBOL using [Material Design In Xaml Toolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) for the .NET environment. It is a simple application for the management of medical appointments. Patients ask for appointments that are automatically assigned to the doctors and these in turn establish the diagnosis. Afterwards, patients can fill out a survey to check their satisfaction. There is also an administrator profile that manages the accounts of different users.


> **Note:** The code is completely written in Spanish
